We developed a web application using the Nuxtjs framework, a tool that allows developers to send their status daily and generate a properly formatted email to project leaders. Additionally, the possibility of editing said mail before being sent in case you want to include some additional information.
This app is not fully developed due to time issues, some features were missing, for example sending the report, a login where users can register and a real API.
